# B3rt1ng's awesome scripts

A collection of the scripts I made for my flipper zero with the [momentum firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware), some features of the JS api are not yet out but accessible through the dev version of the firmware, all the files ending with something like dev.js are subject to that.

## Scripts descriptions

Press the return key to exit the script | no |
